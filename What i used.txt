Apps used:
Pixel Studio (Mobile pixel art editor)
Paint.net (its very used by texture pack creators on PC)
Visual Studio Code (literaly the best code editor... in my opinion)
Acode (Coding app like VS Code but on mobile... or kind of)
ZArchiver
Shizuku (i used it to be able to navigate in com.mojang folder on my phone)
Grok (was a very useful tool, i learned a lot of things with it... it's an A.I.)
Termux (to use GitHub on mobile)
PhotoShop (the pack icon image was made with it)
And of course, Minecraft 
Oh, and by the way, i did unlock the game's root folder (C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_<the_actual_game_version>.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\data\ <-- inside this folder there are a lot of other folders, including the 'resource_packs' and 'behaviour_packs' folders. They have every single vanilla source, from all the versions) but there is a better option: download an APK (better be the latest version of the public... not beta/preview ones. And the sources will be inside an 'assets' folder in the root of the APK file, probably)
